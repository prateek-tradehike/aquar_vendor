Signifyd PHP SDK
================

This repository contains the PHP SDK client for the [Signifyd APIs](https://www.developer.signifyd.com/api/)

Overview
--------
This document will give an overview on the available methods in the Signifyd PHP library. Also examples for this methods will be provided.

Support
--------
For questions or issues please contact our [support team](https://www.signifyd.com/contact/). You can submit feedback and suggestions for improvement [here](https://github.com/signifyd/php/issues).

Examples
--------
If you are looking for a sample code that was tested and works, check out the [`sdk-examples`](https://github.com/signifyd/signifyd-php/tree/development-not-for-use/sdk-examples) repository.

Requirements
------------
* `PHP >= 5.6.0`
* In order to use the API you need to provide your API key. You can find your API key on your [account page](https://app.signifyd.com/settings).

Installing the SDK
------------------
##### With composer

The Signifyd PHP SDK is available on Packagist. To add it to your project, simply run command below to get the latest version:

```
$ php composer.phar require signifyd/signifyd-php
```

If you want you can specify a version by adding it to the command:

```
$ php composer.phar require signifyd/signifyd-php:DESIRED_VERSION_HERE
```

Or add the this line under the `"require"` key in your `composer.json`:
```
{
    "require" : {
        ...
        "signifyd/signifyd-php": "DESIRED_VERSION_HERE"
    }
}
```
Change DESIRED_VERSION_HERE by the version description which most fits to your business. To learn more about version numbers check Composer documentation.

https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md#writing-version-constraints

After adding the line you must install the Signifyd PHP SDK dependency by running:
```
$ php composer.phar install
```

Getting Started
---------------
There are 3 api classes that each represents the 3 main parts of the API

***CASE API*** Which works with cases which are orders submitted to Signifyd for review. A case contains payment, recipient, product, shipping, and account information.

***GUARANTEE API*** Which works with guarantee which is a financial liability shift that protects online retailers in case of chargebacks. View our product manual to learn more.

***WEBHOOKS API*** Which works with webhooks which are messages sent by SIGNIFYD via HTTP POST to a url you configure on your Notifications page in the SIGNIFYD settings. Webhook messages are sent when certain events occur in the life of an investigation. They allow your application to receive pushed updates about a case, rather than poll SIGNIFYD for status changes.

API Clases
----------

### CaseApi

The CaseApi is the class the maps the main case functionality of the Signify API. This class has the methods that work with the Signify investigations (called cases).

There are multiple ways to instantiate the CaseApi class.
Usage examples:
```php
<?php
    // This might differ depending on the location of the file from which you your project
    require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php'; 
    
    $caseApi = new \Signifyd\Core\Api\CaseApi(["apiKey" => "your api key"]);
``` 
Or using the Settings Class
```php
<?php
    // This might differ depending on the location of the file from which you your project
    require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php'; 
    
    $settings = new \Signifyd\Core\Settings(["apiKey" => "your api key"]);
    $caseApi = new \Signifyd\Core\Api\CaseApi($settings);
``` 

#### Class methods
All methods accept two type of data as parameters. 

The parameter as an array, which means that the constructor of the model will set the values of the class properties 
based on the data passed to the constructor.

The parameter as an object, which means that after the instanciate of the class you can use the setters to add data to 
the model.


##### createCase($case);
Submit an order for fraud review.
There are multiple ways for the data to be sent to the createCase method. One way is to send an array with all the data 
required to the createCase method. This is useful if you know what data needs to be sent. 

For more info about the data that can be added please check the `CaseModel` model.
```php
    ....
    // Case data
    $caseData = [
        "purchase" => [
            // Data related to purchase event represented in this Case Creation request.
        ],
        "recipient" => [
            // Data related to person or organization receiving the items purchased.
        ],
        "card" => [
            // Data related to the card that was used for the purchase and its cardholder.
        ],
        "userAccount" => [
            //User account if exists before placing an orders these data values are details from that account. 
        ],
        "seller" => [
            // All data related to the seller of the product. 
        ]        
    ];
    $caseResponse = $caseApi->createCase($caseData);
    ....
``` 
Another way is to use the setters and getters of the models so you can add data.
```php
    ....
    $case = \Signifyd\Models\CaseModel();
    // Purchase array data or Purchase Object
    $case->setPurchase($purchase);
    
    // Recipient array data or Recipient Object
    $case->setRecipient($recipient);
    
    // Card array data or Card Object
    $case->setCard($card);
    
    // userAccount array data or userAccount Object
    $case->setUserAccount($userAccount);
    
    // Seller array data or Seller Object
    $case->setSeller($seller);
    
    $caseResponse = $caseApi->createCase($case);
```
An example of a JSON object sent to our API:

### Address
Contains a shipping/billing address
The address object is a container for the address information, for the order that was placed in your store.
The address class can be found under namespace "Signifyd\Models", located lib/Models/Address.php.

```php
    // instantiating the address model class
    $addressData = ['streetAddress' => '2 Brodway', '...'];
    $address = new \Signifyd\Models\Address($addressData);
```
or
```php
